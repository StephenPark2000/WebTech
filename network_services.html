            <h3>Network Services</h3>
            <p>There are many network services required to allow devices to communicate with each other. Each 
                service provides a specific function.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>DNS</h3>
            <p>
                DNS or Domain Name System as it is officially named can be described by using the analogy of Yellow pages: 
                it a Container for all the addresses and businesses in that area. The same applies for a DNS as it contains 
                lists of all the registered domain names in that specific area or group. Each domain name has a numerical value 
                called the IP address linked to it. The majority of these IP addresses are IPV4 but the migration from this 
                format to the IPV6 has begun so it is likely in future years to see an increase in IPV6 addresses. This value 
                is almost never displayed to the user as it will most likely be meaningless to them and impossible to remember. 
                As a result domain names are used as they are much easier to remember for the user but that 
                does not mean they have no structure. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                DHCP
            </h3>
            <p>
                DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Is protocol designed to automatically assign IP addresses
                to PCs as they connect to the network. This helps managing lots of PCS as the admin will not have
                set static IPs. the DHCP will often have a limited amount of addesses avaialbe to it this is called the Protocol.
                In order to stop running out of addresses in the Pool the DHCP will assign a lease to each address
                after the lease expires the address is returned to the pool.
            </p>
            <h3>
                ARP
            </h3>
            <p>
                ARP or Address Resolution Protocol is a layer 2 protocol that initialises before DHCP to Broadcast
                the devices MAC address across the network to any other device listening. From this broadcast the MAC
                address gets added to the ARP cache which assigns the MAC address to the relevant IP address
                to allow local communication over the network.
