            <h3>Network Types</h3>
            <p>
                There are many different types of networks being used in business, homes and governments. But what
                is a network? A network is simply a series of connected computers that can communicate with each other.
            </p>
            <h4>LAN</h4>
            <p>
                LAN or Local Area Network is the most common type of network found in almost every home in this 
                day and age.
            </p>
            <h4>WAN</h4>
            <p>
                WAN or Wide area Network as the name suggest is a network much larger than a LAN infact it may often
                consist of other LANS. The most popular WAN is known as the internet however many large business'
                and governments may use WANs to privately link their LANs.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Network Topologies
            </h3>
            <p>
                Topogies describe how a network is structured. The following paragraphs will describe the most common
                topologies.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Star
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Star network topology is very common, found in almost every home. It consists of a central point 
                typically a router or switch will all the other devices branching off from this point on their own
                dedicated connection.
                <br>
                This allows the network to be somewhat resiliant to failure as a device may fail
                and not interrupt the function of the network. It also ensures that each connected device is
                not sharing internal bandwidth with other devices.
                <br>
                This is not completely resiliant as if the central point fails the entire network will collapse.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Ring
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Ring topology is very old and is rarely used anymore. It consists of a devices
                connected in a loop. They each take turns to send the data. This network is rarely used
                now but can be found in some very old finacial intitutions.
                <br>
                This network can be quite cheap to setup as it conly requires a single cable to fucntion.
                <br>
                It is very easily broken. if any device fails the entire loop collapses.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Mesh
            </h4>
            <p>
                Mesh networks are becoming more popular thanks to Mesh wifi access points. It can be found in homes
                but is quite popular in businesses. it consists of many branches coneccting to each other much like
                a spider's web with each devices maybe getting 2 connections atleast.
                <br>
                This network os very resiliant to failure as if any device fails it can quickly failover
                to the other connection making it a good pick for businesses.
                <br>
                However this network is very expensive to install and configure, requires alot of cable and some 
                clever routing protocols.
